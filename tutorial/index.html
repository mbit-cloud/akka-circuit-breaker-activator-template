    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>In this template we will take a look at a typical problem when talking to other
        systems: dealing with their failure.</p>

    <p>
        Especially when talking to publicly available services you cannot always operate under the assumption that the
        third-party service will always be available and always preform well.
        One reason for a third-party service not being available can be a high load that is crippling the system.
        Therefore just continuing to send your messages to that system will make the problem worse.
        A better solution would be to detect problems with third-party systems and react accordingly by stopping sending
        requests.
        But this is not only useful in scenarios in which you communicate with third-party services, you can use this to
        avoid overflowing your own actors, as well.
    </p>

    <p>Akka provides a circuit breaker component for this exact scenario in its pattern package, and there is a <a
            href="http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.3.2/common/circuitbreaker.html" class="shortcut">nice documentation</a>
        for it. But in most real-world scenarios using only the circuit breaker will not be enough. In this template we
        will take a look how to deal with the problems that might arise.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>The Service</h2>

    <p>
        First we will need a Service to call. We will simulate this service using an actor. Take a look at the code in
        <a href="#code/src/main/java/Service.java" class="shortcut">Service.java</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Service actor will simulate a service that becomes very slow from time to time.
        In the constructor we set up a regular <code>Swap</code> message, that will be sent to the actor every 5
        seconds.
        When receiving the <code>Swap</code> message the actor will change its behavior. In its normal state it will
        reply to
        each <code>Task</code> message with a <code>Response</code> message. Upon the first <code>Swap</code> message it
        will change its behavior. In this new state it will block for 1 seconds and ignore the message. No response will
        be sent.</p>

    <p>
        The next <code>Swap</code> message will
        revert the Service back to the normal behavior. Please note that blocking inside an actor is an anti-pattern,
        and should not be done normally, as it makes actors unresponsive and takes computing time away from other
        actors. In this case, however, it simulates exactly what we need, a service that does not respond to our
        requests, and does not handle new requests in the mean time. A nice side-effect is that the queued messages
        prevent the swap message from being handled, an indication that us sending the service messages impedes it from
        recovering.
    </p>

    <p>
        Let's see what happens when we run it.
    </p>

    <p>
        We defined a <code>main</code> method in the <a href="#code/src/main/java/Main.java"
                                                        class="shortcut">Main.java</a> class. It creates an actor
        system, and the service actor, before setting up a regular <code>Task</code> message that will be sent every 100
        milliseconds. Then we wait for 30 seconds, before shutting everything down. Thanks to the log statements in the
        actor we can observe what happens when we execute the <a href="#run" class="shortcut">program</a>. Each <code>Task</code>
        message receives incremented ids, so we can follow the messages in the log.
    </p>

    <p>
        First we will see a number of requests and responses, after 5 seconds the first <code>Swap</code> message is
        received and we see that there is a delay of one second between request and response. After 5 seconds the second
        <code>Swap</code> message should arrive, but as there are still <code>Task</code> messages in the
        <code>Service</code> actors mailbox, the <code>Swap</code> message will be delayed. Obviously this is a problem.
    </p>

    <p>
        Let's try to take the load off our service.
    </p>
</div>


<div>
    <h2>Introducing the circuit breaker</h2>

    <p>
        Let us tackle the problem using a circuit breaker. The relevant code can be found in <a
            href="#code/src/main/java/SimpleCircuitBreaker.java" class="shortcut">SimpleCircuitBreaker.java</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Let us go through the code.</p>

    <p> First we need to initialize the circuit breaker:
        <pre><code>new CircuitBreaker( getContext().dispatcher(),
            getContext().system().scheduler(),
            MAX_FAILURES,
            CALL_TIMEOUT,
            RESET_TIMEOUT )</code></pre>
    We need to specify the dispatcher the circuit breaker will be running on, as well as a scheduler. The scheduler is
    necessary as the
    circuit breaker uses <code>Callable</code>s to send the messages to the service. Next, we set the maximum number of
    failed
    attempts before the circuit breaker opens. This setting is very specific to your situation. If the service you
    are talking to is on the same machine as your Akka process, you can use a low setting, as failures are most
    likely caused by problems within the service. On the other hand, a service you connect to through the internet may
    fail on occasion because there are problems with the connection, you will want to make sure that you do not
    stop the message flow just because one or two messages got lost. Similarly the next two settings depend very
    much on your unique situation. First, the call timeout specifies how long the circuit breaker is willing to wait
    for a response. If the response is not received in this timeframe, it will be considered failed. The last
    parameter is the reset timeout, the time the circuit breaker will wait after opening until it tries to send
    another request.
    </p>
    <p>
        After creating the circuit breaker, we register some callbacks to be notified when the circuit breaker changes
        its state. In this case we will simply log the changed state, you could have more complex logic in there though.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>Sending messages</h2>

    <p>
        Now, take a look at lines 61-67 to see how to send messages to the service using the circuit breaker. The
        circuit breaker
        provides two modes of operation, callWithCircuitBreaker will make the call asynchronously and return a future
        containing the result of the call, while callWithSyncCircuitBreaker allows you to perform a synchronous call. As
        you are fully aware, performing synchronous calls inside of actors can be problematic, so we will use the
        asynchronous method here. The method expects a callable object as parameter, which we will declare anonymously
        at this point. The callable needs to return a <code>Future&lt;Object&gt;</code>. This makes it very natural to
        combine the circuit breaker with the <code>Ask</code> Pattern, since it returns
        <code>Future&lt;Object&gt;</code>. We send the <code>Task</code> to the service, and let the circuit breaker
        wait for the response for us. In order to return the result to our caller, we use the <code>PipeTo</code>
        pattern to return the response once the future is done.
    </p>

    <p>
        Time to run the example. Go to the <a href="#code/src/main/java/Main.java" class="shortcut">Main.java</a> class
        and comment line 13, while uncommenting line 14,
    <pre><code>system.actorOf( SimpleCircuitBreaker.props(), "SimpleCircuitBreaker" );</code></pre>
    Once you've done this, click <code>Save</code> and switch to the <a
        href="#run" class="shortcut">Run</a> tab. Activator should run the program after compiling automatically,
    unless you switched this off. In that case, just click the <code>Start</code> button.
    </p>
    <p>
        Using the CircuitBreaker works quite nicely for our use case. After the service switches into slow mode, it will
        still receive some messages until the circuit breaker realizes something is wrong, but then the flow of messages
        stops, and the service can recover. The circuit breaker will probe if the service is available again, and if it
        is, will resume sending the requests.

        There is one problem though. The <code>Task</code> messages that are sent while the Service is in slow mode are
        never delivered.
    </p>

</div>
<div>

    <h2>More on the circuit breaker</h2>


    <p>
        Before we move on, note that we use the call timeout of the circuit breaker for the ask timeout. This may or may
        not make sense for your use-case. You may want to use a longer timeout for the ask, so as to still receive
        responses from the service, even if the circuit breaker will treat that call as failed and cease sending further
        messages. Note that you will need to add handling of the messages in this case, as responses of timed out calls
        are not returned. Also, it is noteworthy that for the asynchronous call method the call timeout is only used to
        decide if
        the call failed or succeeded, the call will not be interrupted after the timeout. This is useful when you want
        to get the result, but it means that the circuit breaker will open only after the call finishes. Try setting the
        ask timeout to a higher value in the code (e.g. <code>500</code>), and see what happens.
    </p>

    <p>
        For some use cases this simple solution is already all you need. But usually creating our messages was hard
        work, we want to make sure they all reach the target. Right now they are just being discarded. So we need to
        make sure to remember all messages for which we did not receive a response from our service yet. There are
        several possibilities to do this. While it is entirely possible to do this using a queue and some
        <code>become</code> magic, this is not necessary anymore. Akka 2.3 saw the introduction of Akka Persistence,
        which allows to persist messages, which sounds like just the thing we need.
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>Adding a channel</h2>

    <p>
        What we are trying to do here, is to accomplish at-least-once delivery. Channels and Persistent Channels are two
        concepts introduced in Akka Persistance that allow to do that. Normally Akka guarantees at-most-once
        delivery (read <a href="http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.3.2/general/message-delivery-reliability.html">here</a>
        for a detailed discussion of message delivery reliability), and this is what we saw in the earlier examples, no
        Task was delivered twice to the service. However, a lot of the Tasks got lost on the way. With at-least-once
        delivery we will make sure that every one reaches
        its destination.
    </p>

    <p>
        When using channels the messages are wrapped in <code>Deliver</code> envelopes and sent to a channel. The <code>Deliver</code>
        envelope in
        turn contains a <code>Persistent</code> envelope and the path of the actor the channels should sent the message
        to. The
        <code>Persistent</code> envelope is used when the message is persisted to disk by the channel. The receiving
        actor will
        receive a message of the type <code>ConfirmablePersistent</code>, on which it can call the
        <code>confirm()</code> method to acknowledge
        successful delivery. The <code>payload()</code> method can be used to return the message contained in the
        envelope. If a
        message is not confirmed after a certain amount of time, the channel will resend the message. If the message is
        still not confirmed after a number of resend attempts the channel will shut down and not attempt to sent further
        messages until it is reactivated.
    </p>

    <p>
        We will use the resending feature to make sure <code>Task</code>s that were rejected by the circuit breaker or
        received no
        response from the service will be resent. In order to do this, the <code>Task</code>s will be first sent into a
        channel, and
        the channel will forward them to the circuit breaker. As we want to make sure that the service received the
        message, the messages will only be confirmed when the response was received. For that we (mis-)use the map
        function on the response future. While the future will be returned unchanged, we will confirm the confirmable as
        a
        side-effect.
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>The persisting circuit breaker</h2>

    <p>
        Take a look at <a href="#code/src/main/java/PersistingCircuitBreaker.java" class="shortcut">PersistingCircuitBreaker.java</a>
        The <code>PersistingCircuitBreaker</code> actor creates the channel in line 28. Channels come with a
        ChannelSettings class that can be used to modify the channel behavior, and comes with a nice fluent Java API. In
        this case, we set the redelivery to 1 second. We also create a circuit breaker actor, that is basically equal to
        the <code>SimpleCircuitBreaker</code> actor we used in the last step. Upon receiving a <code>Task</code> message
        the <code>PersistingCircuitBreaker</code> will wrap it into the two envelopes and send it to the <code>CircuitBreakerPersistentActor</code>.
        Note that we state the original sender as sender of the message, therefore the responses will bypass the <code>PersistingCircuitBreaker</code>
        actor, which is why we do not have any code to deal with <code>Response</code> messages.
    </p>

    <p>
        In <code>CircuitBreakerPersistentActor</code> we had to add handling of <code>ConfirmablePersistent</code>
        messages. We extract and send the payload (which is our <code>Task</code> message), and if we receive a <code>Response</code>
        message, we confirm the original message. Akka Persistence takes care of notifying the channel that the delivery
        was successful, and that the message should not be resent.
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>Running the example</h2>

    <p>Go to the <a href="#code/src/main/java/Main.java" class="shortcut">Main.java</a> class
        and comment line 14, while uncommenting line 15,
    <pre><code>system.actorOf( PersistingCircuitBreaker.props(), "PersistingCircuitBreaker" );</code></pre>
    Once you've done this, click <code>Save</code> and switch to the <a
        href="#run" class="shortcut">Run</a> tab. Activator should run the program after compiling automatically,
    unless you switched this off. In that case, just click the <code>Start</code> button.</p>

    <p>
        Starting the program we now see that after the service recovered it will receive the messages that could not be
        sent during the down time. Usually you will see Tasks 103-112 before tasks 52-102 will be replayed. That is
        because the redelivery time is set to 1 second.
    </p>

    <p>
        Usually you will want to use PersistentChannel instead of Channel. In addition to providing at-least-once
        delivery, PersistentChannel will persist all messages to disk, thus making sure that the messages will be
        replayed after a JVM crash or similar unfortunate incidents. In order to achieve this, go to <a
            href="#code/src/main/java/PersistingCircuitBreaker.java" class="shortcut">PersistingCircuitBreaker.java</a>
        and lines 34-41 in
        the constructor and comment or remove lines 28-31.
        When running the example now you will not see much difference. However, running it a second time you will notice
        that the run does not start with Task 0 instead, it starts with Tasks 50 and other tasks that were not
        delivered in the last run.
    </p>

    <p>
        Persistent Channels offer a number of settings. Two of those are very interesting in our context, pending
        confirmations max and min. With those two values the channel can be stop sending further messages if a certain
        number of messages is not yet confirmed. The min value allows to set a value at which sending will be resumed.
        In effect, this can be used to build a simple circuit breaker.
    </p>

</div>

<div>
    <h2>The persistence only solution</h2>

    <p>
        The last step is to see how well we can make it work using only persistent channel. Take a look at the code in
        <a
                href="#code/src/main/java/PersistingChannelLimiter.java"
                class="shortcut">PersistingChannelLimiter.java</a>. You will note that it contains two other actors.
        First the <code>PersistentReceiver</code>. This is the actor the <code>Tasks</code> are sent to through the channel. The receiver creates
        a temporary actor to deal with each of the messages it received from the channel. Those actors are defined in
        <code>ServiceCaller</code>. They extract the <code>Task</code> from the <code>ConfirmablePersistent</code> and hold the information about the original
        sender and the confirmable in their internal state until they receive a <code>Response</code>. When a <code>Response</code> is received,
        they confirm the original message so that it will not be sent once more and return the response to the original
        sender. After this they are stopped. This is important, as we create a new actor for each task, so this would be
        a memory leak if the actors were not stopped. This is also the reason why we define a receive timeout, so that
        we can stop the actor when the service does not respond, either because it is down, or because the response got
        lost.
    </p>

    <p>
        If we use this solution in our <a href="#code/src/main/java/Main.java" class="shortcut">Main.java</a> method, we see that the output is nearly
        perfect, all messages are
        delivered, only two messages are delivered to the service once it stops being responsive. This approach works
        fine however it has some restrictions. If the response time of the service is slower than the rate of messages
        coming in, this solution can turn into a bottleneck, as the number of maximum pending messages will limit how
        many messages you can send. In contrast the circuit breaker imposes no limits while the service responds, and
        only acts when the service has problems. Therefore we would suggest using the circuit breaker where possible,
        and ensure resending of messages using a persistent channel with unlimited number of pending messages. When the
        service is part of your own system or a responsive system with a very fast connection the channel only solution
        can be interesting to look at, as it is simpler and easier to implement.
    </p>

    <h2>Further exercises</h2>

    <p>
        In order to gain more experience with circuit breakers you can try several things using this template:
    <ul>
        <li>Make the service respond in slow mode and check how the different implementations deal with this</li>
        <li>Add a delay to responding to a Task in normal mode and look at how the different implementations deal with
            this
        </li>
        <li>Use variable delays in the service, make it return or drop responses randomly, which solution is the best
            under this circumstances?
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        We hope you had fun going through this template with us. Any issues, feedback or questions can be given using
        the GitHub page of this template.
